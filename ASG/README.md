# Auto Scaling Group - Barracuda NextGen Firewall Template for AWS

## Introduction
This solution deploys to AWS EC2 an auto scaling group of Barracuda NextGen Firewalls (NGF). Firewall instances are synchronized and deployed behind an Elastic Load Balancer, which makes them visible and acting as a single system. The ASG is by default automatically scaled out/in based on number of concurrent VPN connections.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting to deploy the solution you must create an IAM Role for Barracuda NextGen Firewalls. See [How to Create an IAM Role for an F-Series Firewall in AWS](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/nextgenfirewallf/article/NGF71/AWSCreateIAMRoleFW/) for details.

Solution does not check for availability of requested instance types in a given region. Please consult AWS documentation for instance type availability. Barracuda recommends use of **m4** or **c4** series. Using unavailable instance type will result in ASG not meeting the required initial size and thus failing CloudFormation deployment.

If you plan to use SSLVPN functionality in NGF, you need to provide the solution with ARN of your SSL certificate hosted in AWS Certificate Manager. For details on how to how to use ACM see [Working with Server Certificates](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_server-certs.html) in AWS documentation.

## Deployed Resources

Following resources will be created by the template:
- One VPC with public and private subnets in 2 Availability Zones
- Two Elastic Load Balancers for management and production traffic
- S3 bucket used for configuration and updates synchronization
- Auto Scaling Group with proper Launch Configuration and Scaling Policies
- additional helper elements: routes, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways, SNS topic and SQS queues.
