# ELB Sandwich with ASG of Barracuda NextGen Firewalls

## Introduction
This template deploys an Auto-Scaling Group of NextGen Firewalls into a new VPC, together with a downstream ILB forming a complete ELB Sandwich architecture. Firewall policy is automatically adjusted to allow connectivity through the sandwich for TCP ports 80 and 443. The auto scaling policy based on network packets metrics is installed by default.

## Prerequisites
Before attempting to deploy the solution you must create an IAM Role for Barracuda NextGen Firewalls. See [How to Create an IAM Role for an F-Series Firewall in AWS](https://campus.barracuda.com/product/nextgenfirewallf/article/NGF71/AWSCreateIAMRoleFW/) for details.

Solution does not check for availability of requested instance types in a given region. Please consult AWS documentation for instance type availability. Barracuda recommends use of **m4** or **c4** series. Using unavailable instance type will result in ASG not meeting the required initial size and thus failing CloudFormation deployment.

## Deployed resources
Following resources will be created by the template:
- One VPC with public and private subnets in 2 Availability Zones
- Two Elastic Load Balancers for management and production traffic
- One Internal Load Balancer for the backend workload nodes
- S3 bucket used for configuration and updates synchronization
- Auto Scaling Group with proper Launch Configuration and Scaling Policies
- additional helper elements: routes, Internet Gateway, NAT Gateways, SNS topic and SQS queues.
